##Calculate the total number of transactions made by each user in the "United States" region

SELECT t.id_, r.region_name, t.t_type, t.t_amt,
FROM `BankingAnalysis.Transaction ` t
LEFT JOIN `BankingAnalysis.Region` r ON t.id_ = r.region_id
WHERE r.region_name = 'United States'
GROUP BY t.t_type,r.region_name, t.id_ ,t_amt;

Calculate the total number of users who made more than 5 transactions

SELECT SUM(subquery.transaction_count) AS total_users_with_more_than_5_transactions

FROM (
    SELECT id_, COUNT(*) AS transaction_count
    FROM `BankingAnalysis.Transaction `
    GROUP BY id_
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 5
) AS subquery;

Find the regions with the highest number of nodes assigned to them

select r.region_name, COUNT(n.node_id) AS total_count 
FROM `BankingAnalysis.Region` r
LEFT JOIN `BankingAnalysis.Nodes` n on n.region_id = r.region_id
GROUP BY r.region_name
ORDER BY total_count DESC 
LIMIT 1; 

Find the user who made the largest deposit amount in the "Australia" region

select t.id_, r.region_name, t_type, SUM(t_amt) as total from `BankingAnalysis.Transaction `t 
LEFT JOIN `BankingAnalysis.Region` r ON r.region_id = t.id_
WHERE region_name = 'Australia'
Group By t.t_type, r.region_name, t.id_
ORDER BY total DESC 
LIMIT 1 

Calculate the total amount deposited by each user in each region

SELECT r.region_name, COUNT(r.region_id) AS consumer_count
FROM `BankingAnalysis.Region` r
LEFT JOIN `BankingAnalysis.Nodes` n ON r.region_id = n.region_id
GROUP BY r.region_name
ORDER BY r.region_name;

Retrieve the total number of transactions for each region

SELECT r.region_name, SUM(t.t_amt) AS total_deposit_amount
FROM `BankingAnalysis.Transaction ` t
JOIN `BankingAnalysis.Region` r ON r.region_id = t.id_
GROUP BY r.region_name
ORDER BY r.region_name;

Write a query to find the total deposit amount for each region (region_name) in the user_transaction table. Consider only those transactions where the consumer_id is associated with a valid region in the user_nodes table.

SELECT r.region_name, COUNT(r.region_id) AS consumer_count
FROM `BankingAnalysis.Region` r
LEFT JOIN `BankingAnalysis.Nodes` n ON r.region_id = n.region_id
GROUP BY r.region_name
ORDER BY r.region_name;

How many transactions were made by consumers from each region?

select region_name, COUNT(t.id_) as total_transaction  
from `BankingAnalysis.Transaction ` t
JOIN `BankingAnalysis.Region` r on r.region_id = t.id_
GROUP BY r.region_name
ORDER BY r.region_name
