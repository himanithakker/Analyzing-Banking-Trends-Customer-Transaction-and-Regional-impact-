# Customer Transaction Analysis Project

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to explore customer transactions and identify trends that may impact regional economies and financial systems. By combining data cleaning techniques in Python and utilizing SQL queries on a set of interconnected tables, we aim to gain a comprehensive understanding of how customer transactions vary across different regions and the possible implications on the banking sector.

## Data Sources

This project leverages three key tables that provide valuable information for analysis:

### 1. world_regions Table

- **Description:** This table contains data on various world regions and their corresponding codes and names. It serves as a reference to categorize customers based on their regional affiliation.

### 2. user_nodes Table

- **Description:** The user_nodes table holds crucial details about consumers' banking nodes, including their unique consumer IDs, associated region IDs, node IDs, start dates, and end dates. This data enables us to identify the specific banking nodes to which customers are connected and their duration of association.

### 3. user_transaction Table

- **Description:** This table is a comprehensive repository of customer transactions, containing data such as consumer IDs, transaction dates, types of transactions, and transaction amounts. Analyzing this data allows us to uncover patterns in customer spending and financial behaviors.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning:** We start by cleaning the data using Python data cleaning techniques to ensure the data's reliability and consistency.

2. **SQL Queries:** We use SQL queries to explore and analyze the interconnected tables. These queries provide insights into customer transactions, regional affiliations, and patterns.

3. **Analysis:** The project involves in-depth analysis to identify trends, patterns, and potential impacts of customer transactions on regional economies and the banking sector.

## Conclusion

This project aims to provide valuable insights into customer behavior and regional financial trends by leveraging data cleaning and SQL analysis techniques. The findings may have implications for decision-makers in the banking industry.
